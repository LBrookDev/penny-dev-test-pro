There are four main types: Cash ISAs, Stocks and Shares ISAs, Lifetime ISAs, and Innovative Finance ISAs.  Each has its own benefits and risks.  Cash ISAs offer a safe place to save with tax-free interest, while Stocks and Shares ISAs allow you to invest in a wider range of assets, potentially offering higher returns but also carrying more risk. Lifetime ISAs are designed for first-time homebuyers or retirement savings, offering government bonuses. Innovative Finance ISAs involve peer-to-peer lending, which can be higher risk but potentially higher reward.  You can only hold one of each type of ISA per tax year.  The annual allowance is currently £20,000.

Would you like me to share a link to learn more about ISAs on the Lloyds Bank website?
