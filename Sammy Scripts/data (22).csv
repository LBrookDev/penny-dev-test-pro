They allow you to hold investments without paying Capital Gains Tax on any potential profits.  You can invest up to £20,000 annually in a stocks and shares ISA.  If you're looking to save for a house in the next few years, a Stocks and Shares ISA could be a good option, but remember that investments can go down as well as up, and longer-term investments (5+ years) are generally better suited to weathering market fluctuations.  It's important to consider your risk tolerance and time horizon before investing.
