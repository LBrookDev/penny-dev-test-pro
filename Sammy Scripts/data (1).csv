To proceed, we have two options:

1. If you're happy with where we've left off and would like to end our conversation, please reply with:  `I am happy to finish here`

2. If you'd like to discuss something else related to your finances, or perhaps a different topic altogether, please reply with: `I would like to talk about something new`

Let me know what you'd prefer!
