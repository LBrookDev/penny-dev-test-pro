* **Cash ISAs:** These are tax-free savings accounts where the interest you earn isn't taxed.  This means more of your money grows.

* **Regular Saver Accounts:** These accounts often require you to deposit a set amount each month. They usually offer a better interest rate than standard instant-access accounts.
