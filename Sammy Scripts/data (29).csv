Focusing on a mix of lower and moderate-risk options is sensible when starting out.  Lower-risk investments generally include Cash ISAs, which offer a secure place for your savings to grow, albeit at a slower pace than higher-risk options.  Moderate-risk options could include certain types of bonds or investment funds that aim for a balance between growth and capital preservation.  To understand the risk involved in different investments, it's helpful to consider your investment timeframe and your comfort level with potential fluctuations in value.
