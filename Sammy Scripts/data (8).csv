You can contribute up to £4,000 per year until your 50th birthday.  They're designed to help you buy your first home or save for retirement.  However, Lloyds Bank does not currently offer Lifetime ISAs. You can transfer a Help to Buy: ISA from another bank or financial provider.

Do you have any other savings goals you'd like to discuss?  Perhaps we could explore cash ISAs or other savings accounts?

You can deposit money and grow your savings without paying tax on the interest earned. Lloyds Bank offers several types of cash ISAs, including Instant Access Cash ISAs and fixed rate ISAs.  Cash ISAs are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) up to £85,000 per person, per provider.  They're a good option if you want easy access to your money while earning interest, unlike fixed-rate savings accounts which lock your money away for a set period.

To help you choose the right Cash ISA, it's helpful to understand your savings goals.  Are you saving for a specific short-term goal, or are you looking for longer-term growth?
