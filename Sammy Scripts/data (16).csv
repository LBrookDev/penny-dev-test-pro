The value of your investments can go up and down, and there's always a risk you'll get back less than you put in. You can invest up to £20,000 a year free from Capital Gains or UK Income Tax. You can choose to invest in ready-made funds or build your own portfolio. If you're unsure about investing, seek independent advice.
