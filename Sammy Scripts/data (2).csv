* 1 Year Fixed Rate Cash ISA:  This offers a fixed interest rate for one year and your interest is tax-free.

* Online Fixed Bond (1-year term): This offers a fixed interest rate for one year.  Interest is taxable.
* Online Fixed Bond (2-year term):  This offers a fixed interest rate for two years. Interest is taxable.


The interest rates for these accounts can vary, so it's always best to check the current rates on our website.  Remember, with fixed rate accounts, your money is locked away for the term, so you won't be able to access it easily.
