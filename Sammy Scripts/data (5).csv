Stocks and Shares ISAs allow you to invest in stocks, shares, and funds, tax-free.  Cash ISAs are more predictable and offer lower returns, while Stocks and Shares ISAs have the potential for higher returns but also carry more risk. You can only put money into one cash ISA with Lloyds Bank in a tax year, but you can also pay into any other ISA for which you are eligible in each tax year. You can replace funds within a cash ISA, as long as you replace it in the tax year that it was withdrawn. You cannot do this with a stock and shares ISA. You can have a Cash ISA and a Stocks and Shares ISA at the same time, but you can't subscribe more than £20,000 to any combination of ISAs in the same tax year.

Would you like me to share a link to learn more about ISAs on the Lloyds Bank website?
