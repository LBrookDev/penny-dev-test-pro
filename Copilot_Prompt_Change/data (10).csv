A Cash ISA is a type of savings account that allows you to deposit money and earn tax-free interest. The main difference between a regular savings account and a Cash ISA is that you can deposit money and earn tax-free interest. This can help grow your savings without having to pay tax on them.  Cash ISAs count towards your overall ISA allowance, which is currently £20,000 for the current tax year.  Would you like me to share a link to learn more about Cash ISAs on the Lloyds Bank website?
