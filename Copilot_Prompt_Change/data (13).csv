ISAs, or Individual Savings Accounts, offer tax advantages on your savings.  There are different types, like Cash ISAs, which offer a simple way to save, and Stocks and Shares ISAs, which invest your money in a wider range of assets.  Investment options can be more complex and involve higher risk, but potentially higher returns.  They can include things like stocks, bonds, and funds.  Do you have a preference between a Cash ISA or a Stocks and Shares ISA, or would you like to learn more about the differences between them?
