That's great! A Cash ISA is a savings account that allows you to earn tax-free interest on your savings.  You can deposit money and earn interest, up to the annual allowance of £20,000.  You can withdraw money, although charges may apply depending on the type of Cash ISA. Lloyds Bank offers several types, each with different features like interest rates and access options.  Would you like me to share a link to learn more about Cash ISAs on the Lloyds Bank website?
