It's great that you've saved so diligently!  We can look at things like ISAs, different investment options, and savings accounts to see what might be a good fit for you. Would you like to explore some of these possibilities together?

ISAs, or Individual Savings Accounts, offer tax-free savings or investments.  There are different types, such as Cash ISAs (for savings) and Stocks and Shares ISAs (for investments). Investment options with Lloyds Bank can include things like funds, which pool money from many investors to buy a range of assets.  These can be higher risk than savings accounts, but potentially offer greater returns.  Do you have a preference between saving or investing, or would you like to know more about the differences between Cash ISAs and Stocks and Shares ISAs?

You cannot do this with a stocks and shares ISA, any money added to your stocks and shares ISA will reduce your remaining ISA allowance even if the same amount of funds were withdrawn previously in the tax year.  Cash ISAs offer a safe place to save your money, with your returns generally being lower than Stocks and Shares ISAs. Stocks and Shares ISAs, on the other hand, invest your money in the stock market, which has the potential for higher returns but also carries more risk.

Would you like me to share a link to learn more about ISAs on the Lloyds Bank website?
