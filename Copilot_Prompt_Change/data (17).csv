My name is Penny, and I'm your AI financial companion from Lloyds Bank.  We noticed you have a significant amount of cash in your account, and I wanted to reach out and see if you'd be open to exploring some options to help your money grow.

It's great that you've saved so diligently!  Many people find it hard to save, so well done.  We understand that investing can feel a bit daunting, but there are straightforward ways to make your money work harder for you.  I can introduce you to some Lloyds products like ISAs, different investment options, and savings accounts that might be suitable, depending on your goals.  Would you like to hear a little more about them?

After 12 months, your account will change to a Standard Saver. You can then open a new Monthly Saver and save for another 12 months.
