Since you have a significant amount in your instant access savings account, we could discuss different ways to make that money work harder for you.  One option is an ISA, which stands for Individual Savings Account.  ISAs offer tax advantages on your savings interest. There are different types of ISAs, such as Cash ISAs and Stocks and Shares ISAs.  Cash ISAs are similar to regular savings accounts but with tax benefits. Stocks and Shares ISAs invest your money in the stock market, potentially offering higher returns but also carrying more risk.

Would you like to learn more about ISAs?

They are suitable for the longer term, as the value of investments can fall and rise. You may not get back what you put in. They offer the potential for more significant gains and losses.  They may rise or fall depending on the performance of your investments. You can withdraw your money at any point, however, to avoid losses, it's wise to leave your investment for as long as possible (5+ years). You can invest up to £20,000 a year free from Capital Gains or UK Income Tax.
