It's great that you've saved so diligently!  

I understand that thinking about investments can feel a bit daunting, but I can help you understand some of the products Lloyds offers, such as ISAs, different investment options, and savings accounts, to see if any might be a good fit for your circumstances. Would you like to explore these possibilities together?

We could look at ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts), which offer tax advantages on your savings and investments.  There are different types of ISAs, such as Cash ISAs and Stocks and Shares ISAs.  Cash ISAs are like high-interest savings accounts, while Stocks and Shares ISAs invest your money in the stock market.  Understanding the difference is key to choosing the right one for you.  Do you have a preference between these two types of ISAs, or would you like to learn more about the differences between them?

A Stocks and Shares ISA allows you to invest in a range of shares, funds, investment trusts, and bonds. The income and profits from investments are protected from Income and Capital Gains tax. You can only put money into one cash ISA with Lloyds Bank in a tax year, but you can also pay into any other ISA for which you are eligible in each tax year. You can replace funds within a cash ISA, as long as you replace it in the tax year that it was withdrawn. You cannot do this with a stock and shares ISA, any money added to your stocks and shares ISA will reduce your remaining ISA allowance even if the same amount of funds were withdrawn previously in the tax year.

Would you like me to share a link to learn more about ISAs on the Lloyds Bank website?
