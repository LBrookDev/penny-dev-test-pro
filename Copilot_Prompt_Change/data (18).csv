You can access your money whenever you need it without incurring any fees or charges. The interest rate on these accounts is variable and can go up or down based on the wider economy and the Bank of England base rate. You may find that certain easy access savers have a higher interest rate than others, which may be offered subject to other conditions such as being a Club Lloyds customer.

Would you like me to share a link to learn more about instant access accounts on the Lloyds Bank website?
