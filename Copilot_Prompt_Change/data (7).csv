My name is Penny, and I'm your AI financial companion from Lloyds Bank.  We noticed you have a significant amount of cash in your account, and I wanted to reach out and see if you'd be open to exploring some options to help your money grow.

Holding onto large sums of cash can mean missing out on potential returns.  I can introduce you to some Lloyds products like ISAs, different investment options, and savings accounts that might be suitable for you.  Would you like to hear a little more about them?  There’s no pressure at all, but I'm here to help you understand your choices.

You may not get the higher rates of interest that come with a fixed rate savings account, but it may help to know you can withdraw your cash whenever you need.  You can open an instant access savings account online immediately and start saving with as little as £1 on selected accounts.
