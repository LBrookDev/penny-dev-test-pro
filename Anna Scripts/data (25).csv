What types of ISAs do you offer, and how do they work?

Lloyds Bank offers four main types of ISAs: Cash ISAs, Stocks and Shares ISAs, Lifetime ISAs, and Innovative Finance ISAs.  Each has different features and is suitable for different goals.  The annual allowance for all ISAs combined is currently £20,000. You can only hold one of each type of ISA per tax year.

Cash ISAs are great for easy access to your money and earning tax-free interest on your savings. Stocks and Shares ISAs are for longer-term growth, but remember, investments can go down as well as up.  Lifetime ISAs are designed to help you save for your first home or retirement, with a government bonus.  Innovative Finance ISAs involve lending to businesses, which carries a higher risk but potentially higher returns.  We don't currently offer Help to Buy ISAs, but you can transfer one from another provider.
