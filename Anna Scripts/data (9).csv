Investing a lump sum means putting a large amount in at once. Pound cost averaging involves smaller, regular investments. Diversifying your portfolio spreads your investments across different areas to reduce risk.  A longer-term focus helps manage market fluctuations. You can also invest for income (regular payments) or growth (increasing value over time).  Drip feeding involves automatically investing a set amount each month.

This helps smooth out market fluctuations by buying more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high.

Understanding your risk tolerance is also key – are you comfortable with potentially higher risk for potentially higher returns, or do you prefer a more conservative approach?
