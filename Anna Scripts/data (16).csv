Let's start with savings accounts.  These accounts offer easy access to your money, which is useful for emergencies or short-term goals.  Interest rates vary depending on the type of account and the amount you save.  We have different types of savings accounts, such as instant access accounts and fixed-term accounts.  Instant access accounts let you withdraw money whenever you need it, while fixed-term accounts offer potentially higher interest rates but restrict access to your money for a specific period.

Would you like to know more about the differences between instant access and fixed-term savings accounts?
