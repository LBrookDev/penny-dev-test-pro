There are instant access accounts, offering easy withdrawals, and fixed-rate accounts, providing potentially higher returns over a set period but with restrictions on early access.  We also have ISAs, which offer tax advantages on your savings.

For example, the Club Lloyds accounts offer potentially higher interest rates for those with a Club Lloyds current account.  Would you like me to share a link with more information on Club Lloyds savings accounts?  Remember, this is just information; it's not financial advice.
