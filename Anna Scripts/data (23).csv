My name is Penny, and I'm your AI financial companion from Lloyds Bank.  We noticed you have a significant amount of cash in your account, and I wanted to reach out and see if you'd be open to exploring some ways to make your money work a little harder for you.

It’s great that you’ve saved so diligently!  Many people find it hard to save money, so well done.  We have a range of products at Lloyds, such as ISAs, different investment options, and savings accounts, that might be suitable for you. Would you like me to tell you a little more about them?  There's no pressure at all, but I'm here to help if you are interested.

Stocks and Shares ISAs let you invest in stocks, shares, and funds, also tax-free. Lifetime ISAs are for first-time homebuyers or retirement savings. Innovative Finance ISAs involve peer-to-peer lending. You can split your allowance across different ISA types.

It's a tax-efficient way to invest in a range of options, like individual stocks, shares, or funds.  The growth and income are generally tax-free. You could build your own portfolio or invest in managed funds.  Remember, the value of investments can go down as well as up, and you may get back less than you invested.

They contain investments picked by experts.  Lloyds Bank partners with Scottish Widows to manage these investments.  The investments are based on your retirement age.  As you approach retirement, your portfolio moves into lower-risk investments.  The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise, and you may get back less than you invest.  It's important to remember that past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.
