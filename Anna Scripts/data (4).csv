Certainly!  Stocks and Shares ISAs are a type of tax-efficient account that allows you to invest your money in a range of investments while protecting any income and capital gains from UK tax. They are a suitable alternative if you're looking to invest for between 5 to 10 years, or longer. They allow you to hold investments without paying Capital Gains Tax on any potential profits.  You can invest in a range of shares, funds, investment trusts and bonds.  You can choose to invest hassle-free in ready-made funds or build your own portfolio using a share dealing ISA.  The value of your investment can go down as well as up and you may get back less than you originally invested.  You can only invest using one of these two options in a tax year.  You can subscribe to more than one of any type of ISA including Stocks and Shares ISAs (except for Lifetime ISAs).  Just remember to stay within the yearly tax-free ISA allowance.
