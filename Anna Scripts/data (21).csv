These options can offer potential growth over the long term, but remember that investment values can go down as well as up.  It's always wise to seek independent financial advice before making any investment decisions.

To help me understand your needs better, could you tell me what level of risk you're comfortable with within your investment ISA or general investment account?  For example, are you comfortable with some potential short-term losses for the possibility of higher long-term gains?
