Given you have a significant amount in your instant access savings account (£22,000), we could explore options to potentially make your money work harder.  One option is an ISA, which stands for Individual Savings Account.  ISAs offer tax-free growth on your savings.  There are different types of ISAs, such as Cash ISAs and Stocks and Shares ISAs.  Cash ISAs are similar to regular savings accounts but offer tax advantages.  Stocks and Shares ISAs invest your money in a wider range of assets, potentially offering higher returns but also higher risk.

They may rise or fall depending on the performance of your investments. You can withdraw your money at any point, but it's wise to leave it for as long as possible to avoid losses.

Understanding the time horizon for your savings is important.  Are you saving for a specific goal, like a house deposit or retirement, or is this money for emergencies?

What are the main benefits and considerations for starting a pension?

Pensions are a tax-efficient way to save for retirement.  They offer tax relief on contributions, meaning the government contributes a portion of your savings.  Pensions can also grow your money over time, potentially offering higher returns than savings accounts. However, the value of your pension can go down as well as up, and there is no guarantee of returns.  It's important to consider your retirement goals and risk tolerance before deciding on a pension.  Are you familiar with the different types of pensions available?

* **Personal pensions:** You control contributions and investments.
* **Workplace pensions:** Your employer contributes, often matching some of your savings.
* **State pension:** A government payment upon reaching State Pension age (currently rising).

Each offers tax relief, meaning the government adds to your contributions.  Personal and workplace pensions offer more flexibility and potentially higher returns than the State pension, but also carry investment risk.  The State pension provides a guaranteed income, but the amount may not be sufficient for everyone's retirement needs.

Would you like to explore the features of personal pensions in more detail, or perhaps learn more about workplace pension schemes offered by Lloyds Bank?  I can share a link to a helpful page on our website explaining pensions further if you're interested.
