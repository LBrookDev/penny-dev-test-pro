Cash ISAs are like regular savings accounts but with tax benefits, while Stocks and Shares ISAs invest your money in the stock market, potentially offering higher returns but also higher risk.

That's great you found that helpful, Anna!  Now that we've covered the basics of Cash ISAs and Stocks and Shares ISAs,  would you like to explore other savings options, such as fixed-term savings accounts?  These accounts offer a fixed interest rate for a specific period, which can be beneficial if you know you won't need access to your money for a while.

Lloyds Bank offers several insurance options.  Life insurance could provide financial support for your loved ones if something were to happen to you.  We also have critical illness cover, which offers a lump sum payment if you're diagnosed with a serious illness.  Income protection can replace some of your income if you're unable to work due to illness or injury.  Would you like me to share a link with more information on these options?  If so, I can provide a link to our mortgage life insurance page as a starting point.
