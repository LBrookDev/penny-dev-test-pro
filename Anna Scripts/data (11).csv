Stocks and Shares ISAs allow you to invest in a range of shares, funds, investment trusts, and bonds.  The income and profits from investments are protected from Income and Capital Gains tax.  Cash ISAs are more predictable, showing a steady return on your money, while Stocks and Shares ISAs have the potential for more significant gains and losses.  The main difference lies in the level of risk involved; Cash ISAs are low-risk, while Stocks and Shares ISAs carry more risk.

Would you like me to share a link to learn more about ISAs on the Lloyds Bank website?
