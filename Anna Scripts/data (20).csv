A Cash ISA is like a regular savings account but with tax benefits.  A Stocks and Shares ISA invests your money in the stock market, potentially offering higher returns but with higher risk.

* **Instant Access Savings Account:**  Your money is readily available, but interest rates are generally lower.

* **Cash ISA:**  Tax-free interest on your savings; available as instant access or fixed-term options.  Interest rates tend to be better than standard savings accounts.
* **Stocks and Shares ISA:**  Invests in the stock market, offering potentially higher returns but also higher risk.  You could get back less than you invested.  Both instant access and fixed-term options are available.

* **Cash ISA:** Offers tax-free interest on your savings. Interest rates are generally better than standard savings accounts. You can choose between instant access or fixed-term options.  Fixed-term options may have penalties for early withdrawals.

* **Stocks and Shares ISA:** Invests in the stock market, potentially offering higher returns but also higher risk. You could get back less than you invested.  Both instant access and fixed-term options are available.  Longer-term investment (5+ years) is generally recommended to help weather market fluctuations.  You can withdraw money anytime, but it's best to leave it invested as long as possible to maximize potential returns.  Investment choices include shares, funds, investment trusts, and bonds, or ready-made investment options.  Capital Gains Tax is not payable on any profits.
