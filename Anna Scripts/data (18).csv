For long-term investment growth, consider investing in a pension. Pensions are a long-term investment that could offer more potential growth compared to a savings account, helping you beat the rate of inflation. You could also consider a managed growth fund, which focuses on increasing your capital. Investing for the long term in a Junior Stocks and Shares ISA is another option. Remember, the value of investments can go up and down as they are higher risk, nothing is guaranteed. To ride out market downturns, prepare to keep investments for at least 5 years.

Would you like to explore any of these options in more detail?
