1. If you're happy to conclude our discussion for now, please reply with 'I am happy to finish here'.

2. If you'd prefer to continue discussing retirement planning, or another financial topic, please reply with 'I would like to talk about something new'.

3. If you'd like to explore a guided advice journey to determine a suitable retirement savings product, please reply with 'I would like to do a digi-advice journey'.
