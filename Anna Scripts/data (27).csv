Investing in stocks and bonds involves risk, and it's crucial to understand this before you begin.  With stocks, you're buying a share of a company, so their performance directly impacts your investment.  Bonds are loans to companies or governments, and while generally less risky than stocks, their returns are typically lower.  Your investment timeframe and how much risk you're comfortable with are key factors to consider when deciding between them.
